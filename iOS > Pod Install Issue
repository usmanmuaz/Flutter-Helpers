1- Create a backup ZIP of the ios folder (in case you want to keep something from it).

2- Delete the following folders and files from your project:

Runner.xcodeproj
Runner.xcworkspace
Pods/
.symlinks/
Flutter/ (inside the ios directory)

3- Open the terminal in your project root and run

flutter create .

This command will regenerate all the deleted files and folders.

4 - Now everything should work fine.
